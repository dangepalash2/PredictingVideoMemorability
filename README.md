# Predicting Video Memorability Using Various Features on the Data

Humans have a tendency to remember the things they visualize for some amount of time. Generally these visualization powers of a video are measured in terms of long and short term memorability. From MediaEval we have been given 8000 videos distributed in devtest and test set. Both these datasets consist of short term and long term memory annotations. The task of this paper is to select models in which we are able to predict the values of short and long term memorability effectively. We selected various machine learning models including SVR, Random Forest RNN. Our best model is based on the features captions which use random forest method to predict the values.We have also tried ensemble of two models which had the highest Spearmen coefficient values. Spearman coefficient for the training set is 0.419. Other features such as C3D can also be used to predict the memorability values of the test dataset.
